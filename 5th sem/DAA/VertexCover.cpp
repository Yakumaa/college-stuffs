/*
* Program: Vertex Cover Problem
*
* In the mathematical discipline of graph theory, a vertex cover (sometimes node cover) of a graph is a set of vertices such that each edge of the graph is incident to at least one vertex of the set. 
* The problem of finding a minimum vertex cover is a classical optimization problem in computer science and is a typical example of an NP-hard optimization problem that has an approximation algorithm.
* The vertex cover problem is a classical optimization problem in computer science, and is one of Karp's 21 NP-complete problems.
* 
* Time Complexity: O(E)
* Space Complexity: O(E)
