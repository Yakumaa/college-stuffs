/*
 * Program: Sequential Search Program
 *
 * Sequential search is a method for finding a particular value in a list, that consists of checking every one of its elements,
 * one at a time and in sequence, until the desired one is found.
 * The algorithm used here is a simple linear search algorithm.
 * The algorithm states that, for searching a key in an array, if the key is found, return the index of the key, else return -1.
 * 
 * For example, consider the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and the key 3.
 * The algorithm will return 2 as the index of the key 3.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(n)
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
 *
