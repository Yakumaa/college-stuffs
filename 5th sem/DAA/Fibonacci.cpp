/*
 * Program: Fibonacci Sequence Program
 *
 * Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.
 * The Fibonacci sequence begins as follows: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34,...
 * The first two terms are 0 and 1. All other terms are obtained by adding the preceding two terms.
 * The Fibonacci sequence can be defined recursively as follows:
 * F(0) = 0
 * F(1) = 1
 * F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(n)
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
 *
